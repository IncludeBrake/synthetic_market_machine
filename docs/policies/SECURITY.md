- **Access logging**: Log access attempts without revealing secrets
- **Backup security**: Encrypted backups with access controls

## Network Security

### Network Segmentation
- **DMZ**: Public-facing services isolated
- **Internal network**: Application and database servers
- **Management network**: Administrative access only
- **Zero trust networking**: Micro-segmentation and policy enforcement

### Firewall Configuration
- **Default deny**: All traffic denied by default
- **Explicit allow**: Only authorized traffic permitted
- **Stateful inspection**: Deep packet inspection for threats
- **Intrusion prevention**: IPS rules for known threats

### API Security
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS policy**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing rules
- **API versioning**: Versioned APIs with deprecation policies

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: System compromise, data breach, service outage
- **High**: Security vulnerability, unauthorized access attempt
