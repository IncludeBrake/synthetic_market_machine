# ADR-0001: Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM) - Why and What

## Context

The financial industry increasingly relies on synthetic data for testing, model validation, and regulatory compliance. However, there is no standardized framework for:

1. **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensuring synthetic market data accurately represents real-world scenarios
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Validating synthetic data meets financial regulatory requirements
3. **Operational Integrity**: Maintaining consistent, reproducible validation processes
4. **Risk Management**: Assessing and mitigating risks associated with synthetic data usage

Traditional approaches to synthetic data validation are often ad-hoc, inconsistent, and lack comprehensive governance frameworks.

## Problem Statement

Without a structured validation framework:

- Synthetic data quality varies significantly between providers
- Regulatory compliance cannot be guaranteed or audited
- Risk assessment is inconsistent and incomplete
- Integration with existing financial systems is complex
- Operational reproducibility is difficult to achieve
- Governance and audit trails are inadequate

## Objectives

The Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM) aims to:

1. **Establish Standards**: Create industry-standard validation frameworks for synthetic market data
2. **Ensure Compliance**: Provide automated regulatory compliance validation
3. **Enable Governance**: Implement comprehensive governance and audit capabilities
4. **Facilitate Integration**: Simplify integration with existing financial systems
5. **Promote Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent, reproducible validation processes
6. **Mitigate Risk**: Provide comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Scope

- **Third-party Integrations**: Specific integrations with proprietary systems

## Solution Overview

SMVM will be implemented as a modular Python-based framework with the following components:

### Core Components
1. **Validation Engine**: Statistical and domain-specific validation algorithms
2. **Compliance Checker**: Regulatory requirement validation
3. **Quality Assessor**: Data quality and consistency metrics
4. **Governance Controller**: Policy enforcement and audit logging
5. **API Gateway**: RESTful interfaces for integration
6. **Observability Stack**: Logging, monitoring, and alerting

### Technical Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.12.x (primary), 3.11.13 (fallback)
- **Framework**: FastAPI for web services, SQLAlchemy for data persistence
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Security**: Cryptography-based authentication and authorization
- **Observability**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must support Python 3.12.x as primary runtime
- Cannot depend on Python ≥3.13.x features
- Must be deployable in containerized environments
- Must support both synchronous and asynchronous operations

### Business Constraints
- Must comply with financial industry regulations
- Must support enterprise-grade security requirements
- Must provide comprehensive audit trails
- Must enable integration with existing financial systems

### Assumptions
- Target users have basic Python development skills
- Infrastructure provides adequate computational resources
- External data sources are accessible and reliable
- Regulatory requirements remain relatively stable

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Extend Existing Frameworks
**Pros**: Leverage existing codebases, faster initial development
**Cons**: Legacy constraints, difficult to implement modern requirements
**Decision**: Rejected - Need clean architecture for comprehensive validation

### Alternative 2: Use Commercial Solutions
**Pros**: Faster time-to-market, vendor support
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, customization limitations, cost
**Decision**: Rejected - Need open-source, customizable solution

### Alternative 3: Microservices Architecture
**Pros**: Scalability, technology diversity, team autonomy
**Cons**: Complexity, operational overhead, distributed system challenges
**Decision**: Deferred - Start with monolithic architecture, evolve as needed

### Alternative 4: Different Programming Language
**Pros**: Performance, ecosystem maturity (Go, Rust, Java)
**Cons**: Python ecosystem advantages for data science, slower development
**Decision**: Rejected - Python provides optimal balance for this domain
