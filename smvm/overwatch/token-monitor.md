# SMVM Token Monitor - Dynamic Ceiling Enforcement Rules

## Overview

The Token Monitor implements dynamic token ceiling management for the Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM), ensuring fair resource allocation, preventing abuse, and maintaining system stability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dynamic Allocation
Token ceilings are dynamically calculated based on:
- **System Load**: Higher load reduces individual limits
- **User Behavior**: Efficient users get higher limits
- **Business Priority**: Critical requests get priority allocation
- **Service Health**: Unhealthy services get reduced limits

### 2. Fairness & Equity
- **Proportional Distribution**: Resources distributed based on need and contribution
- **Anti-Gaming**: Prevents users from manipulating limits through request patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating under high load

### 3. Transparency & Accountability
- **Audit Trail**: All token decisions are logged and auditable
- **User Feedback**: Clear communication of limits and reasons
- **Appeals Process**: Mechanism for disputing token decisions

## Token Ceiling Calculation Algorithm

### Base Limits by Service

| Service | Base Tokens | Purpose | Typical Usage |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `ingestion` | 1,000 | Data import/normalization | Bulk data processing |
| `personas` | 2,000 | Persona synthesis | Complex demographic modeling |
| `competitors` | 1,500 | Competitive analysis | Feature comparison, pricing |
| `simulation` | 3,000 | Market simulation | Monte Carlo, scenario analysis |
| `analysis` | 2,000 | Advanced analytics | WTP, elasticity, ROI |
| `overwatch` | 500 | Governance/monitoring | Request evaluation |

### Dynamic Multipliers

#### Load-Based Multiplier
```
load_multiplier = max(0.5, min(2.0, 1.0 / system_load_factor))

Where:
- system_load_factor = current_load / optimal_load
- optimal_load = 0.8 (80% utilization target)
- Range: 0.5 to 2.0 (50% to 200% of base)
```

#### Priority-Based Multiplier
```
priority_multipliers = {
    "low": 0.7,      # 70% of base
    "normal": 1.0,   # 100% of base
    "high": 1.3,     # 130% of base
    "critical": 1.5  # 150% of base
}
```

#### User Behavior Multiplier
```
behavior_score = (success_rate * 0.6) + (compliance_score * 0.4)
behavior_multiplier = max(0.8, min(1.2, behavior_score))

Where:
- success_rate = successful_requests / total_requests (30-day window)
- compliance_score = policy_compliance_score (0.0-1.0)
- Range: 0.8 to 1.2 (80% to 120% of base)
```

#### Service Health Multiplier
```
health_score = (uptime * 0.4) + (error_rate_inverse * 0.4) + (latency_score * 0.2)
health_multiplier = max(0.7, min(1.0, health_score))

Where:
- uptime = service availability (0.0-1.0)
- error_rate_inverse = 1.0 - error_rate (higher is better)
- latency_score = 1.0 - (latency / target_latency) (higher is better)
- Range: 0.7 to 1.0 (70% to 100% of base)
```

### Final Token Limit Calculation
```
dynamic_limit = base_limit × load_multiplier × priority_multiplier × behavior_multiplier × health_multiplier

# Apply bounds checking
final_limit = max(minimum_limit, min(maximum_limit, dynamic_limit))

Where:
- minimum_limit = base_limit × 0.3 (30% of base)
- maximum_limit = base_limit × 3.0 (300% of base)
```

## Enforcement Rules

### Request Evaluation Process

#### 1. Pre-Request Assessment
```
Input: service_request, user_context, system_state
Output: token_decision, monitoring_level

Algorithm:
1. Calculate dynamic_limit using current context
2. Compare requested_tokens vs dynamic_limit
3. If requested_tokens ≤ dynamic_limit:
   - APPROVE with granted_tokens = requested_tokens
   - Set monitoring_level = "standard"
4. Else:
   - DENY with maximum_allowed = dynamic_limit
   - Suggest reduction_suggestion = dynamic_limit × 0.8
   - Log denial reason for audit trail
```

#### 2. Real-time Monitoring
```
During request execution:
1. Track actual token consumption
2. Monitor for anomalies (sudden spikes, unusual patterns)
3. Apply circuit breaker if consumption exceeds 150% of granted
4. Log consumption metrics for behavior analysis
```

#### 3. Post-Request Analysis
```
After request completion:
1. Calculate efficiency_score = (useful_output / tokens_consumed)
2. Update user behavior profile
3. Adjust future limits based on performance
4. Generate usage analytics for capacity planning
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
Trigger Conditions:
- Token consumption > 150% of granted amount
- Consumption rate > 2× expected rate
- Unusual consumption patterns detected

Actions:
1. Log circuit breaker activation
2. Reduce remaining token allocation to 50%
3. Flag user account for manual review
4. Notify service owner of potential abuse
```

## User Communication & Transparency

### Token Limit Notifications

#### Approval Response
```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "granted_tokens": 2500,
  "remaining_capacity": 500,
  "calculation_factors": {
    "base_limit": 2000,
    "load_multiplier": 1.2,
    "priority_multiplier": 1.0,
    "behavior_multiplier": 1.1,
    "health_multiplier": 0.95
  },
  "expires_at": "2024-12-01T15:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Denial Response
```json
{
  "approved": false,
  "requested_tokens": 3500,
  "maximum_allowed": 2100,
  "reduction_suggestion": 1680,
  "reason": "System load factor: 1.8 (high utilization)",
  "next_available_increase": "2024-12-01T16:00:00Z",
  "appeal_instructions": "Contact admin@smvm.company.com with request ID"
}
```

### Usage Analytics Dashboard
```
User Portal Features:

- Efficiency scores and trends
- Upcoming limit adjustments
- Token-saving tips and best practices
```

## Abuse Prevention & Detection

### Pattern Recognition
```
Suspicious Patterns:
1. Token hoarding: Requesting maximum limits without using them
2. Burst consumption: Sudden spikes in token usage
3. Round number requests: Always requesting exact limits
4. Time-based gaming: Requests timed to avoid rate limits
5. Account sharing: Multiple users from same context
```

### Automated Responses
```
Low-level violations (pattern score < 0.3):
- Warning notification
- Temporary limit reduction (10%)
- Behavior monitoring increase

Medium-level violations (pattern score 0.3-0.7):
- Account flag for manual review
- Temporary suspension (1 hour)
- Require additional authentication

High-level violations (pattern score > 0.7):
- Immediate suspension
- Security team notification
- Full account audit required
```

## Scaling & Capacity Management

### Load Balancing
```
Multi-tier allocation:
1. Base allocation (guaranteed minimum)
2. Dynamic pool (shared based on demand)
3. Burst pool (temporary spikes, higher cost)
4. Reserved pool (critical business requests)

Distribution algorithm:
- 60% base allocation (predictable capacity)
- 30% dynamic pool (efficient utilization)
- 10% burst pool (peak handling)
```

### Capacity Planning
```
Metrics monitored:
- Peak utilization by service
- Average request size trends
- User behavior patterns
- Seasonal demand variations
- Technology improvements impact

Scaling triggers:
- Sustained utilization > 80% for 1 hour
- Queue depth > 10 requests for 5 minutes
- Error rate > 5% for 10 minutes
```

## Audit & Compliance

### Audit Trail Requirements
```
