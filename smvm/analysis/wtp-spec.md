# SMVM Willingness to Pay (WTP) Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the methodology for estimating Willingness to Pay (WTP) in the Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM). WTP estimation provides critical insights into pricing strategy, market sizing, and revenue potential assessment.

## Core Concepts

### Willingness to Pay Definition
WTP represents the maximum price a customer is willing to pay for a product or service that provides them with a specific level of utility or satisfaction.

### Estimation Approaches

#### 1. Revealed Preference Approach
Based on actual market behavior and transaction data:
- **Historical Pricing Analysis**: Analysis of price sensitivity from past transactions
- **Competitive Positioning**: WTP relative to competitor offerings
- **Feature-Value Mapping**: Customer valuation of specific features

#### 2. Stated Preference Approach
Based on survey and stated intentions:
- **Direct Elicitation**: Customers directly state maximum willingness to pay
- **Choice-Based Conjoint**: Customers make trade-off decisions between features and price
- **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**: Four price points analysis

#### 3. Hybrid Approach (SMVM Implementation)
Combines revealed and stated preferences with behavioral modeling:
- **Persona-Based Estimation**: WTP derived from consumer segment characteristics
- **Behavioral Economics Integration**: Incorporating cognitive biases and decision heuristics
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: WTP evolution based on market conditions and information

## WTP Estimation Framework

### Consumer Segment WTP Models

#### Premium Segment WTP
```
WTP_premium = Base_Price × (1 + Brand_Premium + Feature_Premium + Quality_Premium)
Where:
- Brand_Premium: 0.3-0.8 based on brand strength
- Feature_Premium: 0.2-0.6 based on feature differentiation
- Quality_Premium: 0.1-0.4 based on perceived quality advantage
```

#### Value-Driven Segment WTP
```
WTP_value = Reference_Price × (1 + Value_Index - Price_Sensitivity_Index)
Where:
- Reference_Price: Market average price
- Value_Index: 0.1-0.4 based on perceived value
- Price_Sensitivity_Index: 0.1-0.3 based on budget constraints
```

#### Price-Sensitive Segment WTP
```
WTP_price_sensitive = Minimum_Viable_Price × (1 + Essential_Value_Factor)
Where:
- Minimum_Viable_Price: Cost-plus minimum margin
- Essential_Value_Factor: 0.1-0.3 for basic functionality value
```

### Uncertainty Quantification

#### Confidence Intervals
WTP estimates include statistical uncertainty bands:
- **Point Estimate**: Single WTP value
- **Confidence Interval**: Range within which true WTP likely falls
- **Probability Distribution**: Full distribution of possible WTP values

#### Sources of Uncertainty
1. **Measurement Error**: ±5-15% from survey/response bias
2. **Model Specification**: ±10-20% from model assumptions
3. **Market Variability**: ±15-25% from external factors
4. **Temporal Changes**: ±10-30% from time-based preference shifts

### Composite Uncertainty Calculation
```
Total_Uncertainty = √(Measurement_Error² + Model_Error² + Market_Error² + Temporal_Error²)
Confidence_Interval = Point_Estimate × (1 ± Total_Uncertainty)
```

## WTP Calculation Methodology

### Multi-Factor WTP Model

#### Base Factors
```
WTP_Base = f(Product_Value, Consumer_Profile, Market_Conditions, Competitive_Landscape)
```

#### Product Value Assessment
- **Functional Value**: Utility derived from core features
- **Emotional Value**: Psychological benefits and brand association
- **Social Value**: Status and social signaling benefits
- **Economic Value**: Cost savings and efficiency gains

#### Consumer Profile Integration
- **Demographic Factors**: Age, income, education impact on WTP
- **Psychographic Factors**: Values, lifestyle, personality influence
- **Behavioral Factors**: Past purchasing patterns and loyalty
- **Situational Factors**: Purchase context and urgency

#### Market Condition Adjustments
- **Economic Climate**: GDP growth, inflation, unemployment effects
- **Industry Trends**: Technology adoption, regulatory changes
- **Seasonal Effects**: Holiday, quarterly, and cyclical variations
- **Competitive Intensity**: Market concentration and rivalry effects

### Advanced WTP Analytics

#### Price Elasticity Integration
```
WTP_Elasticity_Adjusted = WTP_Base × (1 + Elasticity_Correction)
Where Elasticity_Correction = -0.5 × Price_Elasticity_of_Demand
```

#### Cross-Price Elasticity
```
WTP_Complementary = WTP_Base × (1 + ∑(Complementary_Product_Influence))
WTP_Substitute = WTP_Base × (1 - ∑(Substitute_Product_Influence))
```

#### Network Effects Consideration
```
WTP_Network = WTP_Base × (1 + Network_Value_Factor)
Network_Value_Factor = log(Network_Size) × Network_Quality_Coefficient
```

## WTP Distribution Analysis

### Segment-Level Distributions

#### Premium Segment Distribution
- **Mean WTP**: $150-300
- **Standard Deviation**: $45-90

- **Key Drivers**: Brand loyalty, status signaling, quality perception

#### Mainstream Segment Distribution
- **Mean WTP**: $75-150
- **Standard Deviation**: $25-45
- **Skewness**: Normal distribution
- **Key Drivers**: Value for money, feature completeness, reliability

#### Budget Segment Distribution
- **Mean WTP**: $25-75
- **Standard Deviation**: $15-25
- **Skewness**: Left-skewed (price-sensitive floor)
- **Key Drivers**: Essential functionality, cost minimization

### Aggregate Market WTP

#### Market-Level Calculations
```
Market_WTP_Distribution = ∑(Segment_WTP × Segment_Size × Adoption_Rate)
```

#### Revenue Potential Estimation
```
Expected_Revenue = ∑(WTP_Point_Estimate × Purchase_Probability × Market_Size)
Revenue_Range = Expected_Revenue × (1 ± Uncertainty_Band)
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation
```
For i in 1 to N_Simulations:
    Random_WTP = Sample_from_Distribution(WTP_Distribution)
    Random_Elasticity = Sample_from_Distribution(Elasticity_Distribution)
    Random_Market_Size = Sample_from_Distribution(Market_Size_Distribution)

    Scenario_Revenue[i] = Random_WTP × Random_Elasticity × Random_Market_Size
