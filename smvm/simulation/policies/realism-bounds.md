# SMVM Simulation Realism Bounds Policy

## Overview

This policy establishes bounds and constraints for maintaining realistic simulation behavior in the Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM). The policy ensures that simulation outputs remain grounded in real-world market dynamics while allowing for controlled scenario exploration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Empirical Grounding
All simulation parameters must be derived from or validated against real-world data:
- **Data Sources**: Market research, historical data, industry benchmarks
- **Validation Threshold**: 80% correlation with historical patterns
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly review of empirical foundations

### 2. Behavioral Realism
Consumer and competitor behaviors must reflect observed psychological and economic patterns:
- **Cognitive Bounds**: Decision processes limited by information processing capacity
- **Emotional Factors**: Incorporation of loss aversion, social proof, and herd behavior
- **Rationality Limits**: Bounded rationality with systematic biases

### 3. Market Equilibrium
Simulations must maintain market equilibrium unless explicitly disrupted:
- **Supply-Demand Balance**: Automatic convergence to equilibrium prices
- **Competitive Response**: Realistic competitor reaction times and strategies
- **Market Efficiency**: Gradual movement toward efficient market outcomes

## Specific Bounds and Constraints

### Demand Elasticity Bounds

| Scenario Type | Price Elasticity Range | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Luxury Goods | -0.5 to -1.5 | Brand loyalty dampens price sensitivity |
| Commodities | -1.5 to -2.5 | High substitution and price transparency |
| Services | -0.8 to -1.8 | Experience quality influences elasticity |
| Digital Products | -2.0 to -3.0 | Low marginal cost enables aggressive pricing |

**Enforcement**: Automatic price elasticity validation against historical benchmarks

### Conversion Rate Bounds

| Channel Type | Realistic Range | Peak Capacity | Rationale |

**Enforcement**: Channel-specific conversion rate caps with overflow redistribution

### Virality and Network Effects

| Network Type | Reproduction Rate (R0) | Peak Velocity | Decay Rate |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------------|------------|

    # Check demand elasticity
    if not bounds_config['demand_elasticity_range'][0] <= simulation_state['price_elasticity'] <= bounds_config['demand_elasticity_range'][1]:
        violations.append({
            'type': 'demand_elasticity',
            'value': simulation_state['price_elasticity'],
            'bounds': bounds_config['demand_elasticity_range'],
            'severity': 'high'
        })

    # Check conversion rates
    for channel, rate in simulation_state['conversion_rates'].items():
        channel_bounds = bounds_config['conversion_rate_bounds'][channel]
        if not channel_bounds[0] <= rate <= channel_bounds[1]:
            violations.append({
                'type': 'conversion_rate',
                'channel': channel,
