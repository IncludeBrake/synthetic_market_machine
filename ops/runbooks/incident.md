# Incident Response Procedure

This procedure outlines the structured approach to handling security incidents, system outages, and other critical events in the Synthetic Market Validation Module (SMVM) environment.

## Overview

Effective incident response ensures:
- **Rapid containment**: Minimize impact and prevent escalation
- **Systematic investigation**: Thorough analysis of root causes
- **Coordinated recovery**: Efficient restoration of services
- **Continuous improvement**: Learning from incidents to prevent recurrence

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
**Definition**: Complete system outage or security breach with significant impact
- **Examples**: Data breach, full system compromise, regulatory violation
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- **Communication**: Executive leadership within 1 hour
- **Resolution Target**: 4 hours

#### High (P1)
**Definition**: Major functionality impairment or security vulnerability
- **Examples**: Service degradation, partial data loss, authentication failures
- **Response Time**: Within 1 hour
- **Communication**: Team leads within 2 hours
- **Resolution Target**: 8 hours

#### Medium (P2)
**Definition**: Limited functionality impact or minor security issues
- **Examples**: Performance degradation, single user issues, minor bugs
- **Response Time**: Within 4 hours
- **Communication**: Team notification within 8 hours

## Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-1 hour)

#### 1.1 Incident Detection
```bash
# Check monitoring dashboards
# Review alert notifications
# Monitor system health endpoints

curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Health check failed"

# Check application logs
tail -f logs/smvm.log | grep -i error

# Monitor system resources
top -bn1 | head -20

# Check database connectivity
python -c "
import smvm.database as db
try:
    conn = db.get_connection()
    print('Database: ✅ Connected')
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Database: ❌ {e}')
"
```

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Gather initial information
INCIDENT_TIME=$(date)
INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Document initial findings
cat > incident_$INCIDENT_ID.md << EOF
# Incident $INCIDENT_ID
- **Detection Time**: $INCIDENT_TIME
- **Detected By**: [your name]
- **Initial Symptoms**: [describe symptoms]
- **Affected Systems**: [list systems]
- **Estimated Impact**: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
EOF

# Assess severity and impact
echo "Assessing incident severity..."
# Check user impact
# Check data integrity
# Check security exposure
# Determine business impact
```

#### 1.3 Notification and Escalation
```bash
# Notify incident response team
# Send initial alert

     --data "{
       \"incident_id\": \"$INCIDENT_ID\",
       \"severity\": \"P1\",
       \"message\": \"SMVM incident detected - investigating\"
     }" \
     $INCIDENT_WEBHOOK

# Escalate if critical
if [ "$SEVERITY" = "P0" ]; then
    # Notify executive leadership
    echo "Escalating to executive leadership..."
fi
```

### Phase 2: Containment (1-4 hours)

        # Disable network access
        # Suspend affected accounts
        # Implement network segmentation
        ;;
    "data_corruption")
        # Stop data processing
        echo "Stopping data processing..."
        # Quarantine affected data
        # Implement read-only mode
        ;;
    "service_outage")
        # Implement circuit breakers
        echo "Implementing circuit breakers..."
        # Route traffic away from affected systems
        ;;
esac
```

#### 2.2 Preserve Evidence
```bash
# Secure forensic evidence
EVIDENCE_DIR="evidence/$INCIDENT_ID"
mkdir -p $EVIDENCE_DIR
